## Analysis Overview
Programming is a highly demanded skill in both academia and industry. Considering the fact that most students are first introduced to programming in college, it is reasonable to say that early-stage computer science education plays a big role in their future career/research. COGS 18 is one of the most popular introductory level programming courses at UCSD and is taken by more than 1,000 undergraduate students each academic year. Logistically, the course consists of assignments, labs, and a final project to assess students' learning outcomes. Among these tasks, the final project is reflective of a student's ability to learn, design, and implement a programming project independently. For students enrolled in this course or who plan to enroll, many may not be sure about what's a good final project or if they are capable of doing well in the final project. So in this COGS199 research project, I will quantitatively analyze COGS18 final projects from several past quarters to try to guide future students and future iterations of the course.
